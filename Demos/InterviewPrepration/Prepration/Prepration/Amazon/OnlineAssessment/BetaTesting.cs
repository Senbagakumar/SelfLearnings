        //You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
        //You have to finish at least one task every day.The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days.The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
        //Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].
        //Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.

        //Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
        //Output: 7
        //Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
        //Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
        //The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
