        //You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.
        //1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
        //Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i<j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

        //Example 1:

        //Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
        //Output: 3
        //Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
        //(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
        //(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
        //(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
        //Example 2:

        //Input: time = [60,60,60]
        //Output: 3
        //Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
